# MCPVerified

## One-liner
Directory/documentation site cataloging MCP security tools with focus on vulnerability detection and mitigation.

## What it is
- Documentation and catalog site for MCP security solutions
- Lists and describes security tools
- Provides guidance on securing MCP applications
- Not a tool itself - a directory/resource

## Who's behind it
- References Invariant Labs, mcpscan.ai, Semgrep
- Appears to be a community/documentation resource
- Not clear who operates it

## Security tools listed

### 1. MCP-Scan (Invariant Labs)
- CLI tool for vulnerability inspection
- Prompt injection and tool poisoning detection
- Tool Pinning to prevent rug pulls

### 2. MCPScan.ai
- Web-based scanning service
- GitHub repository scanning
- Detailed vulnerability reports
- Enterprise continuous monitoring

### 3. Semgrep MCP
- Static analysis integration
- Code scanning for security vulnerabilities
- Bug and code quality detection

### 4. Invariant Guardrails
- Runtime protection
- Policy-based controls for LLM interactions
- Prompt injection defense

## Focus areas
- Prompt injection attacks
- Tool poisoning
- Cross-origin escalation threats

## Interesting observations
- **Directory, not tool**: Aggregates info about other tools
- **Invariant-heavy**: Multiple Invariant products featured
- **Documentation style**: Educational resource
- **llms.txt indexed**: Structured for AI consumption
- **Verification implied**: Name suggests some vetting, but unclear criteria

## Questions raised
- Who operates MCPVerified?
- What are the verification criteria?
- Is this affiliated with Invariant Labs?
- How is the directory updated?
- What makes a tool "verified"?
