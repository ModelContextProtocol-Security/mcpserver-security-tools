# TrueFoundry MCP Gateway

## One-liner
Enterprise MCP control plane with Kubernetes-native architecture, federated identity, and multi-compliance support (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR).

## Who's behind it
- **Company**: TrueFoundry (Ensemble Labs Inc.)
- **Location**: San Francisco
- **Focus**: Enterprise AI infrastructure
- **Type**: Commercial MCP Gateway

## Problems it claims to solve
- Fragmented access to enterprise tools
- Identity management across MCP servers
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- Lack of observability in agent workflows
- Secure deployment in restricted environments

## Key features

### Access & Discovery
- Unified interface to all registered MCP Servers
- Instant tool discovery via central registry
- Prebuilt connectors (Slack, Confluence, Datadog, Sentry)
- Bring-your-own MCP Server for custom APIs

### Security & Compliance
- Federated login via Okta, Azure AD, other IdPs
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) per MCP Server
- OAuth 2.0 with dynamic discovery
- SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance

### Observability & Operations
- End-to-end request tracing and audit logging
- Structured telemetry (latency, errors, usage)
- Cost attribution and performance monitoring
- Multi-step workflow execution

### Infrastructure
- VPC, on-premises, and air-gapped deployment
- Kubernetes-native architecture
- Multi-region failover support
- High-throughput, production-grade reliability

## How it works
1. **Connect**: Register prebuilt or custom MCP Servers
2. **Authenticate**: Federated identity providers
3. **Discover**: Auto-discover with RBAC enforcement
4. **Orchestrate**: Multi-step agent automations
5. **Govern**: Policies, tracing, auditing

## Deployment options
- Cloud hosted
- VPC deployment
- On-premises
- Air-gapped environments

## Pricing
- Free tier available
- Contact for enterprise pricing

## Interesting observations
- **Kubernetes-native**: Appeals to cloud-native enterprises
- **Air-gapped support**: Government/defense market signal
- **Multi-compliance**: SOC 2 + HIPAA + GDPR in one
- **Prebuilt connectors**: Reduces integration friction
- **Cost attribution**: FinOps consideration built-in
- **TrueFoundry broader platform**: MCP is part of larger AI infra play

## Maturity signals
- San Francisco company
- Multiple compliance certifications
- Enterprise deployment options
- Polished marketing
- Part of broader platform

## Questions raised
- How does Kubernetes-native architecture affect non-K8s users?
- What's the learning curve?
- How does pricing compare to MintMCP/Lasso?
- Is MCP gateway standalone or requires full TrueFoundry platform?
