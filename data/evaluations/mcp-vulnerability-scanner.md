# mcp-vulnerability-scanner

## One-liner
MCP server for scanning IP addresses for vulnerabilities using Nmap and API-driven checks.

## Who's behind it
- **Creator**: Roberto Dure
- **License**: MIT
- **Type**: Security tool VIA MCP (not scanning MCP)

## Important distinction
This is NOT a tool for scanning MCP servers. It's an MCP server that provides vulnerability scanning capabilities for IP addresses. Inverse category.

## What it does
- Scans single or multiple IP addresses for vulnerabilities
- Generates reports with severity, descriptions, remediation steps
- Integrates with MCP-compatible tools like VS Code

## Tools exposed
- `scan-ip`: Single IP vulnerability assessment
- `scan-multiple-ips`: Batch IP scanning

## Scanning methods
- Nmap-based analysis (if installed)
- API-driven vulnerability checks

## Requirements
- Node.js v14.x+
- npm v7.x+
- Nmap (optional, recommended)

## Deployment options
- Local development (`npm run dev`)
- Production builds
- Docker (Dockerfile provided)
- VS Code integration via `.vscode/mcp.json`

## Interesting observations
- **Simple scope**: Just IP vulnerability scanning, not complex
- **Individual project**: Single developer, not company-backed
- **Node.js**: JavaScript ecosystem vs Python-dominant security tools
- **VS Code focus**: Primary integration target
- **Optional Nmap**: Can work without it, enhanced with it

## Maturity signals
- Clear documentation
- Docker support
- Multiple deployment options
- But: individual project, uncertain maintenance

## Questions raised
- What API does it use for vulnerability checks?
- How comprehensive compared to dedicated vulnerability scanners?
- Is it actively maintained?
