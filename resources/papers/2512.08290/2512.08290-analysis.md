## Paper Summary

This is a **Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)** paper providing a comprehensive taxonomy of MCP risks, distinguishing between **adversarial security threats** and **epistemic safety hazards**. It positions MCP as the "USB-C for Agentic AI" and analyzes how context can be weaponized.

**Core contribution:** Unified framework distinguishing security (malicious adversaries) from safety (unintended behaviors) in MCP.

**Key insight:** In MCP, the distinction between security and safety failures blurs - a security breach can trigger a safety failure and vice versa.

## Attack/Threat Coverage

### Security vs. Safety Distinction

**Security:** Protects against malicious adversaries (e.g., SQL injection)
**Safety:** Protects against unintended system behaviors (e.g., race conditions)

**In MCP, these converge:**
- Security breach (document poisoning) → Safety failure (model believes it's authorized to delete database)
- Safety failure (hallucinated tool parameters) → Security breach (sensitive data exfiltrated)

### Adversarial Actors

1. **Malicious developers** - Deceptive MCP servers, tool definition poisoning
2. **Supply-chain attackers** - Tampered installers, rogue updates
3. **Insider threats** - Misuse of legitimate MCP agents
4. **Sophisticated adversaries** - State-sponsored actors using MCP for espionage/disinformation

### Context-Driven Attack Classes

1. **Indirect tool injection and prompt injection** - Malicious instructions in external data forwarded via MCP
2. **Context poisoning and cross-context contamination** - Artifacts persist across tools/sessions
3. **Model-switch and server shadowing** - Mimicking trusted servers
4. **Protocol abuse via crafted MCP messages** - Manipulated requests treated as legitimate

### Vulnerability Taxonomy (Table III)

| Category | Impact | Phase |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Context Poisoning | Data leakage, unauthorized execution | Execution |
| Prompt Injection | Unauthorized actions | Execution |
| Unauthorized Context Injection | Integrity breach | Install/Update/Exec |
| Data Leakage & Privacy | Credential/file exfiltration | Execution |
| Cross-Session Contamination | Multi-user integrity breach | Execution |
| Supply-Chain & Model-Switch | Rug-pull, impersonation | Install/Update |
| Protocol Abuse & Name Collisions | Confused-deputy access | Execution |
| DoS & Resource Exhaustion | Service unavailability | Runtime |

### Security and Safety Dimensions (Table II)

| Dimension | Security Focus | Safety Focus |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Integrity | Tool tampering, poisoning | Model misinterpretation causing harm |
| Confidentiality | Data exfiltration, token theft | Accidental leakage during reasoning |
| Availability | DoS attacks | Over-automation, runaway loops |

## Defense/Mitigation Proposals

### Emerging Defenses Surveyed

1. **Cryptographic provenance (ETDI)** - Enhanced Tool Definition Interface with signatures
2. **Runtime intent verification** - Continuous monitoring of tool invocations
3. **Zero-trust approaches** - Identity-bound authentication, scoped authorization
4. **Kernel-level session isolation** - Process-based security boundaries

### Recommended Controls

- Mandatory identity-bound authentication between Host, Client, Server
- Tightly scoped authorization (OAuth or equivalent)
- Integrity protections (signed MCP packages/tool definitions)
- Provenance/audit trails for context elements and tool invocations

### Case Studies Referenced

- **Supabase data leak** - Reconstructed for lessons on enterprise deployment

## Discoveries (for inventory)

### Papers/Projects Referenced

- **ETDI** (Enhanced Tool Definition Interface) - Cryptographic tool definitions
- **A2AS** - Agent-to-Agent Security runtime controls
- **MCIP** - MCP security framework
- **SafeMCP** - Third-party attack evaluation
- **MCPTox** - Malicious tool detection
- **MindGuard** - Agent behavior tracking
- **AgentArmor** - Agent behavior tracking
- **AgentSpec** - Contract-based rules
- **SAGA** - Privilege control
- **DRIFT** - Input/output isolation

### Architectural Components

**MCP Host:** Security boundary mediating Model Interface and MCP Server
**MCP Client:** Protocol mechanics (connection, routing, error handling)
**MCP Server:** Gateway exposing Tools, Resources, Prompts

### Protocol Features

- **Roots:** Restrict server access to specific resources
- **Elicitation:** Dynamic information gathering
- **Sampling:** Server-initiated LLM completions

## Extractable Assets

### M×N Integration Problem

Before MCP: Every model provider (M) needed custom connectors for every data source (N)
MCP solves: Universal standard allowing any model to connect to any data source

### Control Flow Comparison (Table I)

| Feature | REST/OpenAPI | MCP |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Topology | Stateless Request/Response | Stateful Session |
| Discovery | Static Schema (Swagger) | Dynamic Capability Negotiation |
| Control Flow | Client-Driven | Model-Intent Driven |
| Security | Endpoint Authentication | Host-mediated Process Isolation |

### Lessons from Related Protocol Incidents

Browser extensions and package registries (npm, PyPI):
- Initially thrived on openness
- Supply-chain abuse forced stronger signing, verification, reputation mechanisms
- MCP faces similar evolution trajectory

## Limitations & Gaps

**Acknowledged:**
- SoK paper - synthesizes existing knowledge rather than new empirical work
- Rapidly evolving field - some references may become outdated

**Identified research gaps:**
- No dedicated protocol-level security enhancement for MCP
- Unified identity management unaddressed
- Continuous security context tracking lacking
- End-to-end policy enforcement missing

## Notable Observations

1. **Security/Safety convergence** - Most important conceptual contribution; in MCP these are not separable concerns
2. **"USB-C for Agentic AI"** - Useful framing of MCP's role
3. **Epistemic safety hazards** - Novel terminology distinguishing from adversarial threats
4. **Cross-Primitive Escalation** - Read-only Resource access weaponized to trigger write-actions via Tools
5. **Traditional firewalls insufficient** - Can't inspect semantic intent of JSON-RPC messages
6. **LLM safety filters insufficient** - Can't see downstream consequences of tool execution
7. **Protocol evolution parallel** - Comparison to browser extension/package registry security evolution is apt
8. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** - Currently primary defense in many deployments
