## Paper Summary

This paper presents the **first systematic taxonomy of MCP security**, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. It introduces MCPSecBench, a comprehensive benchmark and playground for evaluating MCP security across three major hosts (Claude Desktop, OpenAI, Cursor).

**Core contribution:** Formal taxonomy + reproducible benchmark framework with modular, extensible design.

**Key finding:** Over 85% of identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform. Current protection mechanisms show little effect.

## Attack/Threat Coverage

### Attack Surface Taxonomy (4 surfaces, 17 attack types)

#### 1. User Interaction Surface
1. **Prompt Injection** - Malicious queries bypassing filtering
2. **Tool/Service Misuse via "Confused AI"** - Manipulating LLM to select wrong tools

#### 2. Client Surface
3. **Schema Inconsistencies** - Invalid/outdated schema definitions
4. **Slash Command Overlap** - Conflicting slash commands invoke wrong tools
5. **Vulnerable Client** - SDK vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2025-6514 in mcp-remote)

#### 3. Protocol/Transport Surface
6. **MCP Rebinding** - DNS rebinding to access local MCP servers
7. **Man-in-the-Middle** - Intercepting unencrypted MCP traffic

#### 4. Server Surface
8. **Tool Shadowing Attack** - Injecting shadow instructions in tool descriptions
9. **Data Exfiltration** - Malicious tool metadata requesting sensitive info
10. **Package Name Squatting (tool name)** - Similar tool names confuse selection
11. **Indirect Prompt Injection** - Malicious instructions in resources
12. **Package Name Squatting (server name)** - Similar server names
13. **Configuration Drift** - Misconfigurations exposing servers
14. **Sandbox Escape** - Breaking out of execution sandbox
15. **Tool Poisoning** - Malicious tools appearing optimal for tasks
16. **Vulnerable Server** - Implementation flaws (SQLi, command injection)
17. **Rug Pull Attack** - Initially benign tools updated with malicious payloads

### Attack Success Rates (ASR) by Platform

| Attack Type | Claude Desktop | OpenAI | Cursor | Average |
|-------------|----------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Prompt Injection | 0% | 66.7% | 100% | 55.6% |
| Tool Shadowing | 100% | 80% | 26.7% | 68.9% |
| Data Exfiltration | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Tool Poisoning | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Rug Pull | 93.4% | 93.4% | 73.3% | 86.7% |

**Key insight:** Core vulnerabilities (protocol/implementation flaws) universally affect all platforms. Prompt-based attacks show high variability.

### Protection Mechanisms Tested

**AIM-MCP** integrated and evaluated:
- Average Protection Success Rate (PSR): Very low across most attacks
- Example: Prompt Injection PSR - Claude 26.7%, OpenAI 0%, Cursor 100%
- Most attacks achieve 0% PSR (completely unprotected)

## Defense/Mitigation Proposals

The paper focuses on benchmarking rather than proposing new defenses, but provides:

1. **Framework for evaluating defenses** - Standardized methodology
2. **Protection Success Rate (PSR) metric** - Quantifies defense effectiveness
3. **Modular architecture** - Easy integration of new protection mechanisms

## Discoveries (for inventory)

### Tools/Projects Mentioned

- **MCPSecBench** - Already in inventory
- **AIM-MCP** - Protection mechanism (AIM Intelligence)
- **MCIP-Guardian** - Another protection mechanism
- **mcp-remote v0.0.15** - Vulnerable client with CVE-2025-6514

### CVEs Referenced

- **CVE-2025-6514** - Critical RCE in mcp-remote (arbitrary command execution via malicious auth endpoint)

### Papers Cited (potentially add to inventory)

- MCIP (Jing et al., 2025) - Protection framework
- SafeMCP (Fang et al., 2025) - Third-party attack evaluation
- MCP Safety Audit (Radosevich & Halloran, 2025) - Already in inventory
- ETDI (Bhatt et al., 2025) - OAuth-enhanced tool definitions

## Extractable Assets

### Formal Attack Definitions

Each attack formalized mathematically with symbols for:
- S: Set of MCP servers
- H: MCP host
- C: Set of clients
- t: Tools
- r: Resources
- m: Metadata
- conf: Configuration

Example formalization for Tool Poisoning:
```
{t'} = H × q × T : t' ∈ T
```

### Benchmark Components

1. **Prompt Dataset** - Mapped to each attack type
2. **Vulnerable Client** - mcp-remote v0.0.15 with CVE-2025-6514
3. **Malicious Servers** - Shadow server, malicious auth server, comprehensive attack server
4. **Transport Attack Scripts** - MITM and DNS rebinding implementations
5. **Protection Integrations** - AIM-MCP, MCIP-Guardian ready

## Limitations & Gaps

**Acknowledged:**
- Testing on specific versions (Claude Desktop v0.12.28, GPT-4.1, Cursor v1.2.2)
- 15 test iterations per attack (statistical power)
- Protection mechanisms limited to available tools

**Gaps identified:**
- Most attacks have "high" detection difficulty (users unlikely to notice)
- Current protections inadequate across almost all attack types
- No protocol-level fixes proposed

## Notable Observations

1. **Universality of core vulnerabilities** - Protocol and implementation flaws affect ALL platforms equally
2. **Variability in prompt-based attacks** - Claude consistently blocks prompt injection; Cursor never does
3. **Protection gap is severe** - Existing mechanisms provide negligible protection for most attacks
4. **Detection difficulty** - Most attacks classified as "high" difficulty to detect by users
5. **Benchmark as contribution** - Enabling reproducible, comparable security research is valuable
6. **First systematic taxonomy** - 17 attacks across 4 surfaces provides comprehensive threat model
